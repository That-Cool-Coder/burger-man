## What can be made in Godot?

A number of successful games have been made in the Godot engine, although I haven't played any of them (I don't play a large variety of games). These are some popular games made with Godot (compiled from Wikipedia and Godot's website):
- TailQuest Defense
- Kingdoms of the Dump
- Cruelty Squad
- City Game Studio

Godot stands out for its specialized 2D engine, which unlike Unity, works in pixel coordinates and **doesn't involve quaternions**. It also has a respectable 3D engine, although it's currently inferior to those of Unity and Unreal Engine.

## Structure of projects and options for coding

Godot uses a node system to structure games. Each node has properties (eg is RigidBody) and uses its subnodes to determine aspects of itself (such as setting the collision shape). The three basic components required to make games in Godot are scenes, nodes and scripts. Assets (art or 3d models) are probably going to be wanted however.

Here is a list of the different methods of coding in Godot:
- using GDScript
- using the C# api
- in another community-supplied binding such as c++
- there's possibly a visual scripting system; I haven't looked into it much though.

I'll be using GDScript as it's the default option and has worked for me on previous projects.

## Possible achievement

I have 6 weeks to program the game. At a rate of 2 double lessons per week, this is 24 hours total work time - the time one might spend on a 3-day jam. Obviously, I could achieve more by working at home but my free time is not guaranteed and I don't want to count on it. Because of the limited time frame, I'll stick to what I know - a 2D game with either levels or a single level which you play multiple times attempting to beat your high score.
